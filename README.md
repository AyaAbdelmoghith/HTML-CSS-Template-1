# HTML-CSS-Template-1

I started studying Front-End path.
I practiced HTML and CSS. 
definitely nothing better than learning through practice so here is my first template.
Note that it's not responsive yet so you need to open it from a laptop. 
I would like to give a special thanks to Engineer Hamza Nabil. 
Eng. Hamza has a playlist on his YouTube channel from which I learned all the principles needed to create this beautiful template.
I was pausing the videos, do the tasks then comparing my coding style to Eng Hamaz's coding style.
